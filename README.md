## 🔧 Implemented Exercises

### ✅ 2.1 Fixed Array Stack – *Josue Zapata*
- Implementation of a basic stack using a fixed-size array.
- Includes error handling for overflow and underflow.
- Printed visual representation of the stack.
- Test cases simulate all operations.
- 💬 *Comments: Clear structure and good testing.*

---

### ✅ 2.2 Dynamic Array Stack – *Gabriel Araujo*
- Stack resizes automatically when full or underutilized.
- `resize()` function doubles or halves the array.
- Efficient space handling with dynamic logic.
- 💬 *Comments: Well-handled resizing logic, great clarity.*

---

### ✅ 2.3 Linked List Stack – *Yamile Ochoa Marin*
- Stack implemented with singly linked list.
- Constant-time operations: push, pop, peek.
- Graceful handling of empty stack scenarios.
- 💬 *Comments: Simple and dynamic, great for memory management.*

---

### ✅ 3.1 Balanced Parentheses Checker – *Yamile Ochoa Marin*
- Stack-based algorithm to check `()`, `[]`, `{}`.
- Handles invalid and nested structures.
- Includes custom test cases and visual diagram.

---

### ✅ 3.2 Postfix Expression Evaluation – *Rodrigo Salva*
- Parses postfix math expressions and evaluates them using a stack.
- Includes support for operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`.
- Custom error handling and floating-point support.

---

### ✅ 4. Real-World: Browser History – *Yamile Ochoa*
- Simulates a browser's back/forward navigation using two stacks.
- Tests different navigation scenarios.
- Handles edge cases like empty history.

---

### ✅ Exercise: Reverse a String – *Josue Zapata*
- Uses ArrayStack to reverse a given string.
- Demonstrates LIFO behavior with visual feedback.

---

### ✅ Evaluate Infix Expressions – *Yair Araujo*
- Converts infix to postfix using Shunting Yard Algorithm.
- Then evaluates the expression using a stack.

---

### ✅ getMin() Stack – *Josue Zapata*
- Custom stack implementation with a `getMin()` method in O(1).
- Uses an auxiliary stack to track current minimums.
- Full test coverage included.

---

### ✅ HTML Tag Checker – *Yair Araujo*
- Stack-based HTML validator that checks for properly nested tags.
- Uses regular expressions and push/pop logic.

---

## 🎯 Conclusions

- **LIFO logic mastered** through multiple implementations and applications.
- **Dynamic vs static memory trade-offs** were analyzed and applied.
- **Stacks are versatile**, solving problems from string reversal to browser history.
- **Testing and documentation** are essential parts of every implementation.
- **Real-world applications** like text editors, expression evaluators, and compilers rely on stacks.
